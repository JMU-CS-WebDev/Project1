<h1><u>About me!</u></h1>
<p> Growing up I was never into any sports or exercising. I never found joy in cardio or any form <br>
    of dancing, biking, or swimming, so the thought of being physically active hardly ever ran <br>
    through my head. I would hide myself in art, or music as my main outlets for distraction and <br>
    even though I enjoyed them, it never offered me the motivation or excitement I needed. After <br>
    high school I stumbled upon the partying scene. It was always filled with welcoming smiles, <br>
    late nights, missed calls and hungover mornings. However, even though alcohol gave me the <br>
    confidence and friends I strived for, it was never permanent. <br>
        Two years ago, I started seeing videos of girls lifting twice their size on social media <br>
    and was amazed that girls could carry twice or even three times their weight. It seemed to me <br>
    (at least at my gym) that most women strayed away from lifting heavy or even doing free weights.<br>
    So, when I began exercising, I was terrified of the weight section of course, and it was like <br> 
    that for months until I finally decided to go in (even when I was terrified). What once seemed <br>
    like something impossible, became my reality: I went from not being able to lift the bar to now <br>
    squatting more than 190 lbs. Before I used to quit things after a week, but it took months to <br>
    perfect my form and technique.  Theres still so much I need to improve, but Im excited to<br>
    continue my fitness journey and see where years of improvement can take me as well as being <br>
    able to help inspire other women into taking the next step! <br>
