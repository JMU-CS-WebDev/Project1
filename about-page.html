<div class="words"><h1><u>About me!</u></h1>
<p> <br><br>  Growing up I was never into any sports or exercising. I never found joyin cardio or 
    any form of dancing, biking, or swimming, so the thought of being physically active hardly 
    ever ran through my head. I would hide myself in art, or music as my main outlets for 
    distraction and even though I enjoyed them, it never offered me the motivation or excitement 
    I needed. After high school I stumbled upon the partying scene. It was always filled with 
    welcoming smiles, late nights, missed calls and hungover mornings. However, even though 
    alcohol gave me the confidence and friends I strived for, it was never permanent.

        Two years ago, I started seeing videos of girls lifting twice their size on social media
    and was amazed that girls could carry twice or even three times their weight. It seemed to me
    (at least at my gym) that most women strayed away from lifting heavy or even doing free
    weights. So, when I beganexercising, I was terrified of the weight section of course, and it
    was like that for months until I finally decided to go in (even when I was terrified). What
    once seemed like something impossible, became my reality: I went from not being able to
    lift the bar to now squatting more than 190 lbs. Before I used to quit things after a week,
    but it took months to perfect my form and technique. Theres still so much I need to improve,
    but Im excited to continue my fitness journey and see where years of improvement can take me
    as well as being able to help inspire other women into taking the next step! </p> </div>
